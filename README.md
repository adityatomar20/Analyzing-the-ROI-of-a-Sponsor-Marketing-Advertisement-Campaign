### Project Overview:

This project aimed to estimate the Return on Investment (ROI) of a sponsor marketing advertisement campaign for an e-commerce platform. The analysis utilized the difference-in-differences (DD) regression method, implemented using the R programming language.

### Difference-in-Differences (DD) Method:

The DD method is a statistical technique employed to estimate the causal effect of a treatment or intervention. In this context, the treatment was the sponsor marketing advertisement campaign. The DD method involves comparing the change in outcomes between a treatment group (exposed to the advertisement) and a control group (not exposed to the advertisement) before and after the treatment. By examining the differences in changes, the method provides an estimate of the causal effect of the treatment.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:

#### Data Loading and Exploration:
The project began with loading and exploring the relevant data using R libraries such as dplyr and ggplot2.

#### Defining Treatment and Control:
The unit of observation was the platform where the sponsored ads ran (e.g., Google).
The treatment involved stopping sponsored ads posted a specific week, while control groups included other platforms like Yahoo, Bing, and Ask.

#### Implementing Difference-in-Differences:
The DD method was executed by calculating the pre-post difference in web traffic arriving from Google (treated unit).
The parallel trends assumption was evaluated to ensure the validity of the DD method.

#### Results and Interpretation:
The DD regression provided insights into the impact of the technical glitch that halted sponsored ads on Google.
A statistically significant decrease in clicks for Google was observed, confirming the hypothesis that users might visit the website via organic links in the absence of sponsored ads.
Adjusting ROI Calculation:

The ROI calculation, previously conducted by Bob, was revisited.
The proportion of true traffic, i.e., clicks truly motivated by sponsored ads, was calculated.
The new ROI was estimated based on the adjusted sponsored ad clicks.

### Conclusion:

The project demonstrated the application of the DD method to estimate the ROI of a sponsor marketing advertisement campaign. The analysis provided valuable insights into the causal effect of the campaign and enabled the adjustment of ROI calculations based on the observed treatment effect. The newfound ROI served as a more accurate representation of the campaign's impact, facilitating informed decision-making for the e-commerce platform.

This project exemplifies the use of advanced statistical methods to assess the effectiveness of marketing strategies, offering a robust approach to causally infer the impact of interventions in a business context.
