## Estimate ROI for Sponsored vs NonSponsored Ads For ECommerce

- The purpose of this project was to estimate the Return on Investment (ROI) of a sponsor marketing advertisement campaign using a statistical analysis method called difference-in-differences regression. The analysis was performed using the R programming language.

- The difference-in-differences (DD) method is a statistical technique used to estimate the causal effect of a treatment or intervention. In this case, the treatment was the sponsor marketing advertisement campaign. The DD method compares the change in outcomes of a treatment group (those who were exposed to the advertisement) with a control group (those who were not exposed to the advertisement) before and after the treatment. By comparing the differences in changes between the two groups, the method estimates the causal effect of the treatment.

- Overall, this project demonstrated the use of the difference-in-differences method in R to estimate the ROI of a sponsor marketing advertisement campaign. The method provides a powerful tool for analyzing causal effects of treatments or interventions, and can be applied to a wide range of business and social problems.
